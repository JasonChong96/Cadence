# Cadence

More details can be found in the report.

## Notes

This application was only tested on a few Android phones and there may be possible bugs due to the differences. The application requires phones to have a built-in step detector. E.g Samsung/LG Phones. Unfortunately there isn't a publicized list of phones that have it but most mainstream phones should.

If you're facing any strange bugs, go to Settings > Applications > Cadence and enable all permissions for Cadence. They are required for Cadence's core functionalities to work.
